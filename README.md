# Payload Blank Template

This template comes configured with the bare minimum to get started on anything you need.

## Quick start

This template uses SQLite by default for local development and can be deployed with a managed database for production.

## Quick Start - local setup

To spin up this template locally, follow these steps:

### Clone

After you click the `Deploy` button above, you'll want to have standalone copy of this repo on your machine. If you've already cloned this repo, skip to [Development](#development).

### Development

1. First [clone the repo](#clone) if you have not done so already
2. `cd my-project && cp .env.example .env` to copy the example environment variables
3. Update `PAYLOAD_SECRET` in `.env` for your local setup
4. `npm install && npm run dev` to install dependencies and start the dev server
5. open `http://localhost:3000` to open the app in your browser

That's it! Changes made in `./src` will be reflected in your app. Follow the on-screen instructions to login and create your first admin user. Then check out [Production](#production) once you're ready to build and serve your app, and [Deployment](#deployment) when you're ready to go live.

#### Docker (Optional)

If you prefer to use Docker for local development, the provided docker-compose.yml file can be used.

To do so, follow these steps:

- SQLite stores data in a local file (default: `payload.db`) and does not require a database server.
- Run `docker-compose up` to start the database, optionally pass `-d` to run in the background.

## How it works

The Payload config is tailored specifically to the needs of most websites. It is pre-configured in the following ways:

### Collections

See the [Collections](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/collections) docs for details on how to extend this functionality.

- #### Users (Authentication)

  Users are auth-enabled collections that have access to the admin panel.

  For additional help, see the official [Auth Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/auth) or the [Authentication](https://payloadcms.com/docs/authentication/overview#authentication-overview) docs.

- #### Media

  This is the uploads enabled collection. It features pre-configured sizes, focal point and manual resizing to help you manage your pictures.

### Docker

Alternatively, you can use [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to spin up this template locally. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Follow [steps 1 and 2 from above](#development), the docker-compose file will automatically use the `.env` file in your project root
1. Next run `docker-compose up`
1. Follow [steps 4 and 5 from above](#development) to login and create your first admin user

That's it! The Docker instance will help you get up and running quickly while also standardizing the development environment across your teams.

## Environment

- `PAYLOAD_SECRET`: required for Payload initialization
- `DATABASE_URL`: SQLite file path for local dev (default in `.env.example`)

## Scripts

- `npm run dev`: start Next.js dev server
- `npm run build`: build for production
- `npm run start`: start production server
- `npm run lint`: lint with Next.js ESLint config
- `npm run test`: run integration tests (Playwright is opt-in)
- `npm run test:int`: run integration tests
- `npm run test:e2e`: run Playwright tests
- `npm run generate:types`: generate Payload types after schema changes
- `npm run generate:importmap`: regenerate Payload import map after component changes

## Testing

1. Integration tests: `npm run test:int`
2. E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e` (optional)
